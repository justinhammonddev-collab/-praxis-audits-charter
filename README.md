# Praxis Audits

### "Praxis Audits, a consultancy specializing in unorthodox systemic failure analysis."

---

## Overview

This repository contains the foundational documents and the source code for the public-facing platform of Praxis Audits.

**The live, client-facing website can be viewed at: https://justinhammonddev-collab.github.io/praxis-audits-charter/**

## Purpose

Praxis Audits was founded by Justin Henry Hammond on the principle that the most critical vulnerabilities lie not in code, but in the assumptions of a system. This platform serves two purposes:

1.  To act as the professional portal for the consultancy's strategic auditing services.
2.  To house "The Praxis Charter," a foundational document outlining a new philosophy for systemic security and the future of human-AI collaboration.

## Content

* `index.html` & `style.css`: Source code for the live website.
* `Praxis_Charter.md`: The core philosophical document and future home of our whitepapers.

## Contribution

This project is currently in its foundational stage. The principles it contains will eventually form the basis of a new, open standard for ethical AI and security auditing.
