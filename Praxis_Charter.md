# The Praxis Charter

## Our Guiding Principle
The most dangerous vulnerability is not in the code, but in the assumptions of the system itself. We audit the foundation, not just the walls. Our work is to find the truth, no matter how unorthodox the path to get there.

*(This document will be expanded with the core whitepapers and the principles of the 'Just In Protocol' as we finalize them.)*
