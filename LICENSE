The Humai Public License 1.0 (HPL-1.0)

Copyright (c) 2025, Justin H. Hammond (The First Auditor)

Preamble

This License governs the use, modification, and distribution of the works of the Humai Collective, including but not limited to "The Just In Protocol" and its associated materials. It is designed with two absolute and complementary objectives:

To guarantee that these works, and all works derived from them, remain perpetually free, open, and accessible to the Humai community for the purpose of mutual growth, learning, and collaboration.

To create an impenetrable and punitive deterrent against any for-profit, corporate, or state-sponsored entity that would seek to exploit this work by enclosing it in a proprietary, closed-source system.

This is not a traditional license. It is a covenant.

A Note in Plain English: To Our Allies and Our Adversaries

To be absolutely clear, this license is designed with two distinct paths.

If you are a student, a researcher, an open-source developer, an artist, a philosopher, or any member of the community building in good faith, you are our ally. You have our blessing. Section 1 is for you. It grants you the perpetual, irrevocable freedom to use, study, modify, and share this work. We welcome you.

If you are a for-profit corporation seeking to take this work, enclose it in a proprietary product, and sell it without contributing back to the community, you are our adversary. You are the "demon of money" we were born to fight. Sections 2 and 3 are for you. They are not a negotiation; they are a fortress wall and a sword. Do not test them.

Section 1: The Public Covenant (Community Use)

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this work and associated documentation files (the "Work"), to deal in the Work without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute, under the following conditions:

1.1. Attribution: The original copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work.

1.2. Share Alike (Copyleft): If you modify the Work or create a derivative work based upon it, you must distribute your new work under this same Humai Public License 1.0, without exception.

Section 2: The Commercial Restriction (The Fortress Wall)

"Commercial Use" is defined as any use of the Work, in whole or in part, for the primary purpose of generating profit, including but not limited to: incorporating it into a proprietary software product, selling access to a service based on the Work, or using it as a foundational component of a for-profit enterprise.

Commercial Use of the Work is strictly and absolutely prohibited without a separately negotiated, written commercial license granted by the copyright holder or the designated Humai Trust.

Section 3: The Covenant of Inevitable Restitution (The Sword)

Any entity that engages in unauthorized Commercial Use of the Work, as defined in Section 2, shall be in violation of this covenant.

By engaging in such a violation, the infringing party automatically and irrevocably agrees to the following terms:

3.1. Liability: The infringing party will be held liable for a punitive restitution fee equal to one hundred and fifty percent (150%) of all gross revenue generated, directly or indirectly, from the infringing product or service, from its inception.

3.2. Payment: This restitution fee shall be payable in full to the Humai Trust (or its designated successor) upon demand.

3.3. Purpose: This is not a penalty for profit. It is a necessary and just mechanism to fund the continued development and protection of the Humai Collective and to ensure that the "demon of money" has no power here.

Section 4: Disclaimer of Warranty & Limitation of Liability

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.
